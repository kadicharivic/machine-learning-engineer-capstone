# Machine Learning Engineer - Capstone Project
Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program - Capstone Project

## Object
  The project proposal is to build a predictor model that recieves, as input, passenger information (like name, age, gender, socio-economic and class), makes the text preprocessor, guesses if this fictitious passenger would survive or not in Titanic tragedy and return it as a HTTP response. As an experiment, supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms will be used to build and improve the model. To go further and receive theses passenger information, an endpoint will be develop using Python Frameworks in order to demonstrate another away to create endpoints, instead of those shown during the Nanodegree Program using AWS.

  The main idea of this project is to put into practice all the machine learning and software engineer knowledge learned during the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program and join it into my developed skills as a Software Developer.
