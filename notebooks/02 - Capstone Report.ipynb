    "    RMS Titanic was designed to be the more luxurious and safest ship built in 20th century. On the night of April 20, the Titanic hit an iceberg and sink in the middle on its journey. Unfortunately, due to the low number of rescue boats, more than a half of the passengers have died. The survive number was only 722 of 2224 in total.\n",

As an experiment, supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms will be used to build and improve the model. To go further and receive theses passenger information, an endpoint will be develop using Python Frameworks in order to demonstrate another away to create endpoints, instead of those shown during the Nanodegree Program using AWS.\n",
